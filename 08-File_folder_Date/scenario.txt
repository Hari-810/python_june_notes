create a console-level application that allows users to manage a simple to-do list. Users can add tasks, view existing tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks. We'll use file handling techniques to store the tasks in a text file.

Here's how the application might work:

When the application starts, it checks if the task file exists. If not, it creates a new file to store tasks.

The user is presented with a menu of options:

    Add a new task
    View existing tasks
    Mark a task as completed
    Delete a task
    Exit the application

Based on the user's selection, the application performs the corresponding action.




















































import os

# File path to store tasks
TASK_FILE = 'tasks.txt'

def create_task_file():
    """Create a new task file if it doesn't exist."""
    if not os.path.exists(TASK_FILE):
        with open(TASK_FILE, 'w') as file:
            pass  # Create an empty file

def add_task(task):
    """Add a new task to the task file."""
    with open(TASK_FILE, 'a') as file:
        file.write(task + '\n')

def view_tasks():
    """View existing tasks."""
    if os.path.exists(TASK_FILE):
        with open(TASK_FILE, 'r') as file:
            tasks = file.readlines()
            if tasks:
                print("Tasks:")
                for index, task in enumerate(tasks, start=1):
                    print(f"{index}. {task.strip()}")
            else:
                print("No tasks.")
    else:
        print("No tasks.")

# Define other functions for marking tasks as completed and deleting tasks
