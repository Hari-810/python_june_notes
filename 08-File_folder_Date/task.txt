Objective:
    Develop a console-based application to handle file and folder operations, 
    including creating files, writing to files, reading from files, appending to files, 
    creating folders, and listing files in folders. Implement error handling for various scenarios.

Key Features:
    File Management:

        Create a new file.
        Write content to a file.
        Read content from a file.
        Append content to a file.

    Folder Management:

        Create a new folder.
        List files in a folder.

    Error and Exception Handling:

        Handle file not found errors.
        Handle file already exists errors.
        Handle permission denied errors.
        Handle other OS-related errors.

Classes and Functions:
    - No explicit classes are needed for this application.
    - Functions for file and folder operations:
        - create_file()
        - write_to_file()
        - read_file()
        - append_to_file()
        - create_folder()
        - list_files_in_folder()
    - Input validation functions for user input.

Steps to Complete the Code:
    1. Define functions for each file and folder operation with error handling.
    2. Implement input validation functions for user input.
    3. Create a main function to provide a menu-driven interface for users to choose operations.
    4. Handle exceptions and display appropriate error messages.
    5. Test the application with various scenarios, including creating files/folders, reading/writing files, and listing files in folders.
