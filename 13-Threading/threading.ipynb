    "3. **Running**:\n",
    "    - The thread is actively executing its task.\n",
    "    - In Python, this typically means that the thread is executing the code inside its `run()` method.\n",

    "4. **Blocked/Waiting**:\n",
    "    - The thread can transition to a blocked/waiting state when it needs to wait for some event or resource.\n",
