    "**Inheritance** is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. The class that inherits is called the \"subclass\" or \"derived class,\" and the class from which it inherits is called the \"superclass\" or \"base class.\" In Python, inheritance is achieved using the syntax class Subclass(BaseClass):.\n",
    "\n",
    "By inheriting from a superclass, the subclass automatically gains access to all the attributes and methods defined in the superclass. This allows code reuse and promotes the concept of hierarchical relationships between classes."
