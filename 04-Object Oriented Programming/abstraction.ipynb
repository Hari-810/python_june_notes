    "Abstraction in Python, as well as in object-oriented programming (OOP) in general, is a concept that allows you to create abstract classes and methods that define a common interface without providing implementation details. It enables you to focus on the essential features and behavior of an object or a system while hiding the unnecessary complexities."

    "In Python, abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and abstract methods. An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is meant to serve as a blueprint for other classes. It often contains one or more abstract methods, which are declared but do not provide an implementation in the abstract class itself. Instead, the subclasses derived from the abstract class must implement these abstract methods.\n",
